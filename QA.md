## Q1: Which is gas optimal? `IPAccountStorage__ZeroIpAssetRegistry()` (and one for each of the registries) vs `IPAccountStorage__ZeroAddress(string name)` (name  of the registry having 0 addr. Just like IPAssetRegistry__ZeroAddress(string name)).
*The first one is more gas optimal. Each error signature will be stored in the bytecode and be used for revert. The second stores only one error signature but will also store all the string literals that will be pass to the error in the code inside the bytecode. So the literals can even be larger than the signatures of the first option. Plus there will be more runtime gas because the returned data will have the selector + the string.*
